I am a Senior Research Associate specializing in RF Cyber Security, with extensive academic and professional experience in electrical and electronic engineering. I hold a Ph.D. from the University of Nottingham, UK, where my thesis focused on near-field MIMO for wireless communication in complex environments. My research interests include spectrum sharing, PHY Layer Algorithm development, reverberation chamber measurements, channel measurements and characterization, machine learning applications in wireless communication, passive RF sensing, and all aspects of software-defined radios.
